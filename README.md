spring2017.veryinteractive.net
======================
This website is for the Spring 2017 semester of Interactive Design at California College of the Arts. Its design is based on the main veryinteractive.net theme by Laurel Schwulst.

### Colophon

Design and programming is by [Mindy Seu](http://mindyseu.com) and [Laurel Schwulst](http://beautiful-company.com).

The site is built on [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/).

### Installation

After downloading, add a new folder “content” to the root directory. Inside “content”, add two new empty folders: “error” and “home”.

I like to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info) to locally run PHP. If you use MAMP, place folder in MAMP’s “htldocs” folder. Navigate to /panel and you should be on your way.
