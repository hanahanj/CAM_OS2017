## Instructions

1. Using (link: https://www.sfmoma.org/search/?q=&type=exhibition popup: yes text: SF MOMA's Archives) as a source for content, select a past exhibition. 
2. Create a microsite showcasing the work in that exhibition. 

## Goals

Determine the tone and focus of your selection. How can you make a website that highlights the information (location, date, time, descriptions, metadata, etc) about this exhibition while showcasing the content in an engaging way? How can you explore different ways of showing the tone? Should it be legible? Formal? Ambient? Obtuse?

Consider the ideal viewing conditions for your site. Are you literally representing the in-person experience online as in the case of (link: http://rumors-studio.com/projects/error text: 404 Error: The Object is Not Online popup: yes)? Are you meant to view your exhibition within the space on your phone like (link: http://www.walkerart.org/garden/ text: Minneapolis Sculpture Garden popup: yes)? Consider augmenting your website with a physical display.
